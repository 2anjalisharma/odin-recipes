INGREDIENTS IN HOMEMADE VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM

Egg Yolks - These create the base for our ice cream custard. We'll gently heat the egg yolks to pasteurize them, but you can also purchase pasteurized eggs if you prefer.

Sugar - For sweetness and amazing ice cream texture, plain, white, granulated sugar is the perfect choice.

Vanilla Bean - We will be using the entire vanilla bean in this batch of ice cream. The seeds go in, and the vanilla bean pod is cooked and steeped with the milk too. There's so much flavor in the pod! If you can't find a whole vanilla bean, you can use two tablespoons of vanilla paste instead.

Whole Milk - Milk is cooked with the egg yolks and sugar to create our custard base.

Salt - Just a bit of salt balances the sweetness and makes everything taste a bit brighter.

Heavy Cream - Making ice cream with both heavy cream and whole milk is what gives us the best creamy texture.

Vanilla Extract - Vanilla is a must for almost all of our ice cream recipes, but it is especially important in this one. It elevates the simple flavors of milk, sugar, and cream, and takes the vanilla bean flavor over the top!

HOW TO MAKE VANILLA BEAN ICE CREAM FROM SCRATCH
Start the day before by making sure that the bowl for your ice cream maker has at least 24 hours to freeze solid.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until smooth and pale yellow in color.

Split the vanilla bean in half and scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean. You'll be using both the seeds and the pod, so don't throw anything away!

Add the milk, salt, vanilla bean seeds, and vanilla bean pod to a saucepan over medium heat. Bring the milk to a simmer and then remove from the heat. Be sure not to boil. Add about ½ cup of the hot milk to the egg and sugar mixture and whisk constantly until combined. 

Then, add the tempered egg mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining hot milk. Heat the saucepan on low. Stirring constantly, heat until the base has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. This should take a few minutes. 

Strain the mixture into a bowl to remove any pieces of egg that may have cooked. Add back the vanilla bean pod to the mixture. Then, add the heavy cream and vanilla extract and stir to combine. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap making sure to have the plastic wrap touching the surface of the ice cream base. This will help keep it from forming a skin while chilling. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours.

Discard the vanilla bean pod. Churn the ice cream mixture in the bowl of your ice cream machine according to your manufacturer’s instructions (mine took about 25 minutes), until it is thick and the consistency of soft-serve ice cream.

Spoon the ice cream into a shallow container or a loaf pan. Press plastic wrap or wax paper to the surface of the ice cream. Freeze for at least 4 hours, or until solid. 
Let sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before serving.
